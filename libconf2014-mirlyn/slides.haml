%section
  %h2 Who uses your library, and what are they trying to do?
  %ul
    %li.fragment
      Need to define
      %em every
      word in that question
  %aside.notes Who feels like they have a good handle on that question?

%section
  %h2 All Animals are created equal
  %p.fragment ...but some are more equal than others

  %h2 Data-driven decisions?

  %h2 Does that get us most of what we need?      

%section
  %h2 Data-driven decisions?
  %p 
    In an average year, the average patron interacts with a librarian 
    %strong ZERO
    times (to several significant digits)
  %p.fragment.em source: totally made up
  %aside.notes But you know it's true

%section
  %h2 What percentage of your patrons
  %ul
    %li.fragment ...get personalized help from a librarian at a reference desk?
    %li.fragment ...attend classes on library use?
    %li.fragment ...use chat/email reference?
    %li.fragment ...look at instructional posters/screens/whatever?
    %li.fragment.strong ...ever even enter the building?

   
%section
  %h2 Electronic interaction data to the rescue!
  %ul
    %li.fragment Gather smart logging data!
    %li.fragment ...from lots of diverse systems
    %li.fragment ...about people that you'll never meet
    %li.fragment ...whose intentions are totally opaque
    %li.fragment ...that reveal no personally-identifying information
    %li.fragment ...and are periodically scrubbed and destroyed


%section
  %h2 What kinds of questions?

%section
  %h2 The easy-but-important stuff
  %ul
    %li.fragment How many times is [X] viewed?
    %li.fragment What percentage of users are on [X] technology
    %li.fragment What are the overall traffic patterns (scheduled maintenance)
    %li.fragment What are the section-by-section patterns (over time)

%section
  %h2 Google Analytics
  %ul
    %li Easy peasy to set up
    %li Gets you a looooooong way there
    %li More sophisticated every release
    %li Answers all the easy questions and more

%section
  %h2 Slightly harder questions:
  %p How much time and energy should I spend on <X>
  %ul.fragment
    %li Smart paging / infinite scrolling
    %li Previous/Next buttons
    %li Detailed views
    %li.fragment.red Are poorly used things unwanted or unknown? Are high-use things clicked out of desire or desperation?
  %aside.notes If your 'help' link is clicked a lot, this is not an indicator that you should spend a lot of time on your help pages!!!

%section
  %h2 Harder interesting questions
  %ul
    %li.fragment How often are people doing discovery vs. known-item searching?
    %li.fragment Are people finding stuff quickly enough?

%section
  %h2 "Hey, you! What do you have against Usability Testing?"
  %ul
    %li.fragment 
      Nothing    
      %span.fragment.red -ish
    %li.fragment Interested in both usability and utility
    %li.fragment Knowing what people do is a good hint to their intentions

%section
  %h2 The kicker
  %p I'm not interested in clicks. I'm interested in patrons.
  %p.fragment Differentiate between things with broad use and those with narrow but intense use.


%section
  %h2 My approach to gathering data in the catalog
  %ul
    %li Every important link has an (illegal HTML) 'ref' attribute
    %li It has pipe-delimited data in it
    %li When clicked, an AJAX call sends a "fire and forget" call which is logged to a database

%section
  %h2 What to gather?
  %p Depends on the type of action. 
  %p Generic: Take up to four extra pieces of data
  %ul
    %li.fragment Action (80ish)
    %li.fragment Search text / index
    %li.fragment Record being acted upon
    %li.fragment Number of results
    %li.fragment Index in list (e.g., '1st', '2nd')
    %li.fragment Link text / link target domain 
  %p.fragment Store with the sessionID, timestamp
  %p.fragment
    %a{:href=>'../static/mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Search/res.html'} Search Results 
    = " / " 
    %a{:href=>'../static/mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Record/rec.html'} Record view

%section
  %h2 But....why???
  %p.fragment Because I know how to push around a relational database

%section
  %h2 Sample data
  %ul


%section
  %h2 Overview
  %ul
    %li Last four months or so
    %li 1.04M recorded events
    %li 260K sessions
    %li How many without any searches?
    %li.fragment
      %ul
        %li 72K
        %li 50% are clicks on e-links; did their search elsewhere
        %li 25% people logging in to renew/check their accounts
        %li Some undetermined number are ILL, bookmarks, etc.
    %li.fragment
      188K sessions with searches
      %ul
        %li 60K have nothing but a single search
        %li Another 23K have nothing but multiple searches

%section
  %h2 The enemy of my data
  %p.fragment ...is the useful search-results page
