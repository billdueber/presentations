  %h2 Axioms
  %p.fragment Decisions should be informed by data
  %p.fragment 
    Data that are hard to get to 
    %strong aren't used to inform decisions

      doing?

  %h2 How to get librarians what they need to know?
  %ul
    %li 
      Make decisions without data
      %span.fragment.red BAD
    %li.fragment
      Ask me to get the data for them
      %span.fragment.red Better
    %li.fragment
      Let them ask the data themselves
      %span.fragment.red Best

%section
  %h2 "It's too complex for (some segment of) librarians!"
  %ul
    %li.fragment No, it's not
    %li.fragment ...and your (somebody's) job is to make it easier

%section
  %h2 Three Virtues of the programmer
  %ul
    %li.fragment
      %strong.red Laziness
      %span.fragment I'm sick of adding functionality to the catalog just because the official client stinks
    %li.fragment
      %strong.red Impatience
      %span.fragment Oh my god, do I have better things to do than run these simple reports
    %li.fragment
      %strong.red Hubris
      %span.fragment "I bet I can build something..."

%section
  %h2
    I
    %em have
    to do this
  %p.em I need a list of all records published any UK country that do have an OCLC number but don't have an ISBN, restricted to those that have at least one item attached to it that has been checked out in the last five years. Exclude serials but include monograph series.
  %p.fragment.red That's made up, but not too far off

%section
  %h2 Should I really have to do this?
  %p.em I need a shelf list of all items in AAEL purchased during calendar 2011 whose call numbers start with QA. Include the title, barcode, record number, and a sortable call number


%section
  %h2 A solution in two parts:
  %ol
    %li ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
    %li Build a Data Warehouse Front End!
    %li.fragment Now you have two more problems.

%section
  %h2 Two (plus one) things Systems Librarians must accept
  %ul
    %li.fragment 
      The data we have are, at the edges, terrible
      %span.fragment
        %em.red Catalogers are among the most anal people on the planet. This is the best humans can do  
    %li.fragment 
      My ILS stores data in useless/crazy ways
      %span.fragment 
        %em.red Let go of your anger. Assume they were drunk!
    %li.fragment Any system that relies on MacroExpress is contributing to the downfall of civilization
  
%section
  %h2 What do I mean by bad data?
  %p.fragment There's nothing like a faceting catalog to expose bad data
  %ul
    %li.fragment 
      Top two LC Subject headings:
      %ol
        %li.fragment "United States"
        %li.fragment "United States."
    %li.fragment About 120 records with the title 'test'
    %li.fragment Over 1000 records with a 245 of '#'
    %li.fragment Unable to test spelling suggestions

%section
  %h2 Some data is inherently...unweildy
  %p.fragment Call numbers

%section
  %h2 
    "Wow, your UMich data is 
    %em awful
    !"
  %p
    Not saying we're any 
    %em better
    than anyone else...

%section
  %h2 Examples from HathiTrust catalog
  %ul
    %li Tens of thousands of records with no title
    %li Missing/short/long/multiple 008s
    %li Two-byte characters in the fixed fields
    %li 23 of the 26 letters of the alphabet as indicators (plus #_-/\&^$)
    %li.fragment Ask me about encodings. Go ahead. Ask me.
    %li.fragment.red Please please please don't ask me
  
%section
  %h2 What do I mean by bad ILS storage (Aleph)?
  %ul
    %li.fragment Insane. Crazy, batcrap insane.
    %li.fragment Dates and times are stored as 12-character strings (YYYYMMDDHHSS)
    %li.fragment Many numbers are stored in CHAR fields
    %li.fragment The invoice number is in characters 21-35 of field z30_rec_key_3 in the z30 table
    %li.fragment.red It's not a relational database. It's an expensive COBOL store.
    
%section
  %h2 E & T (Extract and Transform)
  %p Fix your data as best you can on a copy
  %ul
    %li.fragment Not hard, just slow
    %li.fragment 
      First system based on 
      %emTalend; 
      Rewriting to use 
      %em traject
    %li.fragment Use numeric/date types, varchars, normalize case, etc.
    %li.fragment Constant arms race with MacroExpress
    
%section
  %h2 L (Load)
  %ul
    %li Totally separate database
    %li Only take what we need
    %li Table structure, normalization, foreign keys, indexes all for querying
    %li Fill it up anew every night

%section
  %h2 The Front End: Two ways to go
  %ul
    %li.fragment Lots of canned reports
    %li.fragment 
      Query builder
      %span.fragment.red âˆš
    %li.fragment I give The People what they want, and what they want is spreadsheets

%section 
  %h2 Development strategy
  %ul
    %li.fragment Legacy development stack from hell with lipstick
    %li.fragment Mine ticket system for past report requests
    %li.fragment Build them
    %li.fragment People ask for more/different
    %li.fragment Build it
    %li.fragment Ask people to complain
    %li.fragment 
      Fix stuff
      %span.fragment.red ...in realtime!
    %li.fragment
      %bold.red Need to fight a culture that assumes things can't be changed

%section
  %h2 Security....schecurity
  %ul
    %li Query built up based on names of form elements
    %li.fragment tablename-_-columnname[-_-range/date/whatever]
    %li.fragment Ridiculously insecure
    %li.fragment
      BUT
      %ul
        %li Access is restricted
        %li DB is read only
        %li Data renewed nightly

%section
  %h2 Before
  %ul
    %li 3-4 report requests a week, plus some canned stuff in ARC
    %li Mostly pretty simple
    %li One day turnaround time for the easy stuff

%section  
  %h2 After
  %ul
    %li 3-4 report request a week
    %li Mostly more complex
    %li.fragment Feb. 2014: 38 users generated 283 reports
    %li.fragment ...80 of which are by one user

%section
  %h2 The lesson
  %p If you build it, they might make better decisions
